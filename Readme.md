# About how many hours did it take for you to implement this task?

It took me about 2 hours to get everything installed and became familiar with Empirica. I only spent half an hour coding so the end result still showed a lot of the template code. 

# What was your biggest challenge in implementing this task?

I feel it is a bit hard to understand how the experiment is really conducted. I think I need a lot more information about what the experiement really includes upon further communication to grasp a more accurate and full picture.

# What was a key design decision you made for this implementation?

I don't think I have dived deep into thinking about the design decision yet as I started the project a little late cuz of the health issues and did not have enough time to actual write the code part for implementation. But the general idea that I have is to follow the flow/step of the experiment and have each step of instruction as a separate JavaScript XML file.
